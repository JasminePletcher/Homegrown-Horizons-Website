# Homegrown Horizons Website

An agile prototype project built on Microsoft's base ASP.NET website framework.
This project will use ASP.NET's base tutorial’s layout, such as utilizing the square 
images that users can click on for more information. However, this project's pictures and 
descriptions will be of indoor houseplants and not crafts. 

To differ the project from the base tutorial basic CRUDi (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality is implemented through 
additional features. Users are able to view a gallery of indoor plants and filter results, create their own posts to upload to the community gallery, update posts, and delete posts. 

Homegrown Horizon’s main objective is to provide a platform for aspiring house plant owners to begin their 
indoor plant journey.
