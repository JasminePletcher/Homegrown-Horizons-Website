# Homegrown Horizons Website
- An prototype Agile Project built on the base ASP.NET Core Website.
This project will use this base tutorial’s layout, such as utilizing the square 
images that users can click on for more information. However, this project's pictures and 
descriptions will be of indoor houseplants and not crafts. 

To differ our project from the base tutorial we will add basic CRUDi (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality through 
additional features. Users are able to view a gallery of indoor plants and filter results, create their own posts to upload to the community gallery, update posts, and delete posts. 

Homegrown Horizon’s main objective is to provide a platform for aspiring house plant owners to begin their 
indoor plant journey.
